## Aerolab challenge
This is a coding challenge proposed by [Aerolab](https://aerolab.us/coding-challenge-instructions?utm_campaign=Coding%20Challenge) where I used [React](https://reactjs.org/) frameworks and [chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com/) to style the components. 
In this app, after fetching two api to get users and products' data, I showed the preice of each product. The user is able to sort products by price (from highest to lowest price, and vice-versa) and the user can see how many points they have in their account distinguish those products that they can redeem from those they cannot.
A  *“Redeem now”* option should appear when the user interacts with a product that they have enough points to claim, and after clicking the system should automatically deduct the item’s price from the users’ points and  stored them. 
I builded the following link that allow you to access to my app:
