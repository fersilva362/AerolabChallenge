This is a coding challenge proposed by [Aerolab](https://aerolab.us/coding-challenge-instructions?utm_campaign=Coding%20Challenge) where I used [React](https://reactjs.org/) frameworks and [chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com/) to style the components. 
In this app, after fetching two api in order to get users and products' data I showed each product with a visible price in points. The user is able to sort products by price, from highest to lowest, and vice-versa. The user can see how many points they have in their account and I des![AerolabScreen]
igned  a clear way that allows the user to distinguish those products that they can redeem from those they cannot.
A *“Redeem”* button should be available for those products that the user has enough points to claim and a *“Redeem now”* option should appear when the user interacts with a product that they have enough points to claim. When the user doesn’t have enough points for a product, they are able to see how many more points they need to claim it.
The user aren't allow to redeem a product for which they don’t have enough points. When the user clicks on the Redeem now button, the system should automatically deduct the item’s price from the users’ points and those are stored which can be accessed by a clickable redeem icon that allow the user to see the redeemed items. 
After make some changes that display the products in differents pages, I builded the following link that allow you to access to my app:
